            <h2>Philosophy:</h2>
            <p>
                I firmly believe that the greatest risk we face in software development is that of overestimating our own knowledge. Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. <q>Good programmers write code that humans can understand</q>. This philosophy guides me in my professional life, shaping my approach to write easy to understand code with efficient algorithms .

                In life i believe in <q>Be Patient and Give your Best</q>
